This directory contains the Graphite2 library from https://github.com/silnrsi/graphite/

Current version derived from upstream release version 1.3.4


Note about updating:
The .sh script in this directory is defunct, but kept in place as a guide to follow manually.

Most notably:
  * <cstdio> needs to be replaced with <stdio.h> in *.cpp/*.h #includes
  * Windows.h needs to be replaced with windows.h (caps) -- currently not an issue.
