This directory contains the Graphite2 library from https://github.com/silnrsi/graphite/

Current version derived from upstream release version 1.3.6.

Edits were made to make it suitable for the Pale Moon source tree (as outlined below)
but the library is otherwise direct from upstream and unaltered.


Note about updating:
The .sh script in this directory is defunct, but kept in place as a guide to follow manually.

Most notably:
  * <cstdio> needs to be replaced with <stdio.h> in *.cpp/*.h #includes due to build issues
    otherwise.
  * Windows.h needs to be replaced with windows.h (caps) -- currently not an issue.
  * MozGrMalloc.h, Makefile.in and moz.build need to be preserved in src/
  * Update source files and exports in moz.build with added/removed files in files.mk
    (_SOURCES => CPP_SOURCES and _PUBLIC_HEADERS => EXPORTS.graphite2)
